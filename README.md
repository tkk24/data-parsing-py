# Website Data Parsing
<ins>There are three different forms of web data that I have decided to parse:<ins>

The first is a public API of video game statistics, specifically from the game *Animal Crossing: New Horizons*. I am specifically parsing a specific statistic on the game (the selling price of types of fishes) and comparing them to each other. I also create a graph of the statistics of the selling prices, which is at the end of the .ipynb notebook.

The second is by web scraping through a web page. I decided to choose Baseball Reference as my website, and I specifically looked through the web page with Shohei Ohtani's statistics. I looked for the number of home runs he hit and strikeouts he swung, and compared them to find a correlation between the two.

The final form is a direct download of online datasets, and I decided to use a .csv file. The .csv file I parsed used cancer statistics in the U.S., where I programmed the Python program to find the state with the most deaths due to cancer.
